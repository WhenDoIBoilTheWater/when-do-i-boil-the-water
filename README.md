When Do I Boil The Water? is a full-stack web application dedicated to making a cook's life simpler and faster. 

The app will allow users to either input data to create meals or choose from pre-existing meals. Each meal contains a recipe with a set of steps and ingredients. The end-time of each meal will be inputted, along with other data. Given that data, the app will then utilize pre-built timers to calculate and display projected times of each step within the given recipe.

In addition to the meal planning function, the user will have access to a database of ingredients for each meal and recipe. The user also has the option to manage recipes via add, delete or edit functions. Finally, the app contains a search function for recipe data.
