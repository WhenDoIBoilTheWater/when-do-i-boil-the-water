When Do I Boil The Watr? is a full-stack web application dedicated to making a cook's life simpler and faster. 

The app will allow users to either input data to create meals or choose from pre-existing meals. Each meal contains a recipe with a set of steps and ingredients. The end-time of each meal will be inputted, along with other data. Given that data, the app will then utilize pre-built timers to calculate and display projected times of each step within the given recipe.

In addition to the meal planning function, the user will have access to a database of ingredients for each meal and recipe. The user also has the option to manage recipes via add, delete or edit functions.

ENTRY PAGE
The user will first see a landing page with "Saved Meals" at the top. There will be a list of clickable meals in rows. Clicking on the hamburger buttons (the three vertical dots) on the right of each meal will display a drop-down box of the meal's recipe.
Below the title are two buttons (), New Meal and Cookbook, as well as an entry for a pre-built sample meal (Jasmine Rice).

NEW MEAL
The user will enter a page that says "What's For Dinner?" and view a database of meals (each containing recipes for that given meal). The user will then click on each meal to put it in the red box below. The user then has the option to either cook the meal, save the meal, or abort the meal.

	COOK: Once the meal is placed in the red box, the user hits cook to start the timer for the meal. The timers are pre-installed for each meal and will alert the user to complete a task at a given time. At the end of the operation, the menu will display SERVE!
	SAVE: Clicking SAVE saves the meal to the front page database of meals.
	ABORT: Clicking ABORT ends the existing operation with the meal and takes the user back to the frontpage.

*COOKBOOK (This may be removed in the future)
The cookbook page will take the user to a page that says "Add a new recipe:". At that point, the user is presented with input fields involving recipe names, serving sizes, descriptions, ingredients, ingredient quantities and step lengths (measured in time) for each recipe.
Once the user submits the information, the user hits submit and the recipe is saved to the database.
